### This app is powered by react and node
### for development the react and node app should be started.

## the usually react commands functions for devs:
    -- npm run start for starting the app in development mode
    -- npm run build for building the production version
    -- npm run eject for risky jobs

## i added two commands: 
    --npm run debug for starting the node server with nodemon
    --npm run server for starting with default server option.
